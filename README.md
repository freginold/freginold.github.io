This is a practice website, mostly as a starting point for the [portfolio project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage) on Free Code Camp. It includes links to browser extensions as well as open source projects that I've worked on.
